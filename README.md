Welcome to the Python Exploits community!

Here I make a bunch of code, either for a joke, to invoke fear, or to destroy your pc.
They will be grouped, Harmless for simply harmless things (Like 1 off crash, popupâ€™s ect), Scary (Random cmd popping up showing code ect) and harmful (WILL BREAK YOUR PC)

Will only work on windows, unless otherwise stated
This is for educational purposes, Do not use to harm others devices. I am not responsible for an damages
